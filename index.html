            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public schools. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.  . Other classifications focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical education. Additionally, the term "education" can denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals and the academic field studying educational phenomena.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The term "education" originates from the Latin words educare, meaning "to bring up," and educere, meaning "to bring forth." 1   The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various fields. 2   Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving goals like the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. 3   However, extensive debate surrounds its precise nature beyond these general features. One approach views education as a process occurring during events such as schooling, teaching, and learning. 4   Another perspective perceives education not as a process but as the mental states and dispositions of educated individuals resulting from this process. 5   Furthermore, the term may also refer to the academic field that studies the methods, processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and learning. 6   Having a clear understanding of the term is crucial when attempting to identify educational phenomena, measure educational success, and improve educational practices.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education serves various roles in society, spanning social, economic, and personal domains. Socially, education establishes and maintains a stable society by imparting fundamental skills necessary for interacting with the environment and fulfilling individual needs and aspirations. In contemporary society, these skills encompass speaking, reading, writing, arithmetic, and proficiency in information and communications technology. Additionally, education facilitates socialization by instilling awareness of dominant social and cultural norms, shaping appropriate behavior across diverse contexts. It fosters social cohesion, stability, and peace, fostering productive engagement in daily activities. While socialization occurs throughout life, early childhood education holds particular significance. Moreover, education plays a pivotal role in democracies by enhancing civic participation through voting and organizing, while also promoting equal opportunities for all.</p>
